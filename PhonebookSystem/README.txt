	Phonebook Mini Project in C
Phonebook is a very simple mini project in C that can help you understand the basic concepts of functions, 
file handling and data structure. This application will teach you how to add, list, modify or edit, search 
and delete data to/from the file. Adding new records, listing them, modifying them and updating, search for
 contacts saved, and deleting the phonebook records are the basic functions which make up the main menu of 
this Phonebook application (as shown in the main menu screenshot below). Personal information such as name, 
sex, fatherâ€™s name, phone number, citizenship number, email and address are asked while adding a record into 
the Phonebook. These records can then be modified, listed, searched for and removed.

I have used many functions in this mini project. These functions are easy to understand as their name only signifies their respective operations.
